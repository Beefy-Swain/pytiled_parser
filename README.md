# PyTiled Parser

PyTiled Parser is a Python Library for parsing 
[Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/) (`.tmx`) files used to generate 
maps and levels for 2D top-down or side-scrolling games.

PyTiled Parser is not tied to any particular graphics library, and can be used
with [Arcade](http://arcade.academy), 
[Pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.3-maintenance/), 
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), etc.

The [Arcade](http://arcade.academy) library has 
[supporting code](http://arcade.academy/arcade.html#module-arcade.tilemap) to 
integrate PyTiled with that 2D libary, and 
[example code](http://arcade.academy/examples/index.html#tmx-files-tiled-map-editor) showing its use.
